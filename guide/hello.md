Hello World
-----------

In FTL, software refers to messages in a given language through unique
identifiers.

    hello = Hello, World!

This is an entity called `hello`. Entities are containers for information. You
use entities to identify, store, and recall information to be used in the
software's UI.

In its simplest form, an entity has just a single string value; here *Hello,
World!*. Most of the entities you will work with in FTL will look similar to
this. Some will be more complex, have more than one value variant, or use
expressions to select the right variant depending on the circumstances.
