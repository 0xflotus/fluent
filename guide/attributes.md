DOM Attributes
--------------

    login-input = Predefined value
        .placeholder = example@email.com
        .aria-label = Login input value
        .title = Type your login email

Use attributes when localizing more complex UI components such as DOM elements.

UI elements often contain multiple translatable messages per one widget. For
example, an HTML form input may have a value, but also a `placeholder`
attribute, `aria-label` attribute and maybe a `title` attribute.

Another example would be a Web Component confirm window with an `ok` button,
`cancel` button and a message.
